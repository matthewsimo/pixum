About:
Quick little command line tool to create images in the directory you're in. Pulls down the image from the fantastic service http://lorempixum.com/ 

Usage:
"pixum width height name" 

Example:
you ~ $ pixum 600 400 pic1

Notes:
I would have really liked to have this auto-copy it to your pasteboard, but apparently the pbcopy command doesn't handle images, and so - if I come up with a way for that later, I'll add it in. But don't hold your breath, this was a silly little experiment.

Installation:
Put the pixum script somewhere your bash profile PATH, otherwise you have to run this by referencing it's location in the actual command (i.e. "~/bin/pixum 600 400 pic1" - (assuming it's in a folder 'bin' at ~ )). If it's not letting your run it, do a "chmod 700 pixum"

Use as you like, May the force be with you.
